# Agentes Inteligentes - Multi-Agent System
University project for Intelligent Agents in Java - subject of Software Engineering at University of Minho.

## So, what is this?
This project involves the creation of a multi-agent system, in particular a bicycle-sharing system where the agent User and the agent Station communicate and deal with the renting of the bicycles. The point is to have multiple Stations that never get to full capacity by having an intelligent system that offers rewards to the Users when they are in a determined area close to the stations so that they park elsewhere where there's more space.

Made in a Java using the Jade environment and the XChart library in order to show graphics and statistics for a better understanding and system monitoring.
